For example, McDonald's in India actually has completely vegetarian options. Due to the **large** population of vegetarians in India, McDonald's has 2 segregated kitchens for vegetarian and non-vegetarian food. In addition, they don't serve any beef items, in contrast to the McDonald's in the US, which is primarily beef burgers. Honestly, I love McDonald's in India! They've managed to merge Indian flavors into simple American burgers and come out with amazing dishes such as the McSpicy Paneer and McAloo Tiki Burger. If you haven't yet, you should definitely try the McSpicy Paneer Burger, it's my favorite! :) \n\n![](https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7447/16213447308_f042572573_b.jpg)\n\nMy cousin recently had a major craving for Mexican food. The only problem is that we're in India and the Mexican food available doesn't taste quite the same nor as authentic. In order to quench our cravings, we even tried going to Taco Bell, which has a new item called the Paneer Tikka Masala Burrito! Unfortunately the menu had been too Indianized and no longer tasted Mexican. While this style of Taco Bell is very popular with people in India, it doesn't quite measure up to the Taco Bell we have in the US. \n\n![](https://fbcdn-sphotos-f-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xap1/v/t1.0-9/p240x240/10500572_10153058890499813_8118498097049613786_n.jpg?oh=045ce9ccadee439cd72f5918fcb7bb3e&oe=55583775&__gda__=1431596238_63eebcd5fe7f4c135a000227d439d70b)\n\nOur best bet was to figure out how to make it our selves.

Many people tend to substitute dahi for sour cream out of convenience, however, this doesn't have quite the same taste. Conveniently, we found a fairly easy <a href=\"http://www.tarladalal.com/Sour-Cream-(--Wraps-and-Rolls)-32623r\">recipe</a> on how to make our own homemade sour cream!

Making the refried beans for the tacos ended up being extremely time consuming. If I had been in the US, I could have just bought a can of beans, cooked them with some cumin and cayene pepper and been done with it. I completely took for granted the preparation needed to make refried beans. First you needed to soak and cook the beans until they were soft, and then cook them in a pan with the appropriate seasoning. This took much longer than I had originally expected.\n\n![](https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7400/15778603364_95408ed417_b.jpg)\n\nWe realized even making tortillas by hand wouldn't be so bad.

First off, there's no turkey. Secondly, [my mom](http://uppukhara.com) makes an glorious disply of Thanksgiving inspired Indian dishes! From masala dosa with cranberry chutney to stuffing upma (or bread upit) and spicy herb yams, we always enjoy a large variety of dishes. My only requirement every year is pumpkin pie! I love pumpkin pie. The wonderful blend of spices and sweet. And yet it's not that sweet. Perfect for someone without a strong sweet tooth. \n\nWhat to you get when you combine two of my favorite desserts in the world, pumpkin pie and tiramisu? Basically, it's one of the greatest desserts ever created by man. I was a little skeptical about how well this combination of flavors would accepted with all of our thanksgiving guests, but it was a hit. Even without adding the usual brandy, rum, or amaretto, everyone loved the wonderful blend of flavors. \n\nOne warning I have about this recipe is that you should be careful in blending the cornstarch mixture into the pumpkin creme.

First off, there's no turkey. Secondly, <a href=\"http://uppukhara.com\">my mom</a> makes an glorious disply of Thanksgiving inspired Indian dishes! From masala dosa with cranberry chutney to stuffing upma (or bread upit) and spicy herb yams, we always enjoy a large variety of dishes. My only requirement every year is pumpkin pie! I love pumpkin pie. The wonderful blend of spices and sweet. And yet it's not that sweet. Perfect for someone without a strong sweet tooth. </p>\n\n<p>What to you get when you combine two of my favorite desserts in the world, pumpkin pie and tiramisu? Basically, it's one of the greatest desserts ever created by man.
