    <h3>
        Hello and welcome :)
        <br>
        <small>
            This is the blog of Sumu and Anu, wayfaring adventurers and aspiring home cooks.
        </small>
    </h3>
</p></center>

<p>We've known each other pretty much forever, and this blog is our way of documenting our culinary exploits, and some non-culinary exploits as well. We're not always on the same page, or in the same state, or even on the same continent, but two things are generally true: at least one of us is not paying attention, and at least one of us is wearing her pajamas.</p>

<center><p>Email both of us at <a href="mailto:team@cookinginpjs.com">team@cookinginpjs.com</a>.<br>If you want to contact either of us individually, please email <a href="mailto:sumu@cookinginpjs.com">Sumedha</a> or <a href="mailto:anu@cookinginpjs.com">Anagha</a></center>
